  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `PurchaseSummary` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `pruchaseSummaryId` on the `PurchaseSummary` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `purchaseSummaryId` to the `PurchaseSummary` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
